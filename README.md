# Speech-Evaluation-using-Machine-Learning

The idea behind this project is to build a Machine learning model which evaluates Speech/Presentation given by humans.

## This model will be divided into various parts.

#### 1. Speech Emotion recognition
  - Main use of this model will be to check if the Human in the audio is nervous or not.

#### 2. Speech Acuracy analyzer
  - This will be used to analyse the content of the speech and a score will be generate based on it

#### 3. Filler words detector
