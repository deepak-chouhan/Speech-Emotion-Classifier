Title: Speech Emotion Classifier
Goal: To train a machine learning model which help classify emotions from give audio sample.
Technologies used: Python, Pandas, Numpy matplotlib, scikit-learn, librosa
Approach:
- The purpose of this project is to take the audio file as input and classify emotions ("Calm", "Sad", "Happy", "Fearful", "Angry") in it.
- This Model is part of a project where we analyse the Speech/Presentation given by user with the help of machine learning.
- Used the RAVDESS dataset, which includes audio sample of different actors of both genders which is helpful for better Accuracy.
